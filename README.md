# Hello From The Outside
## Outside Hacks IV submission

Hello From The Outside is an Android application that lets you keep in touch with your friends at concerts and other large social events. The app eliminates the traditional, inconvenient, and often hectic method of messaging back and forth frantically in an attempt to establish a meeting time and location. Instead, by creating a private Google Maps session for a group of friends, which notifies the user when approaching another member of the party (via vibration for eyes-free use), the app reduces time consumed in coordination as well as the panic associated with losing sight of your friends, relieving attendees and giving them the freedom to enjoy the concert without interruption.
